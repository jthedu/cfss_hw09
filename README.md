# Homework 09: Analyzing text data (Julia Du)

Detailed instructions for this homework assignment are [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/homework/text-analysis/).

## Executing the files

You can find the source code at [hw09.Rmd](hw09.Rmd) and the rendered report at [hw09.md](hw09.md). 

There's nothing special about running these files - just open the .Rmd files & knit them to get the .md rendered reports.

## Required packages

You should have the following packages installed:

```r
library(reprex)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)


library(stringr)
library(rvest)
library(glue)

```

The 3rd chunk is needed to scrape a website in hw08_p2.Rmd. The 4th chunk is needed to use an API in hw08-p2-API.Rmd.
